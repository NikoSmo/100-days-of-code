### Day 0: December 14, 2017

**Thoughts:** Learned concepts such as :
CREATE TABLE, UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, SET, WHERE, CASE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM, AVG . . .

### Day 1: December 16, 2017
Skipped a day, b.c. of reasons.

**Today's Progress**: worked on my chatbot, inspired by sentdex, improving database generation f√ºr a larger and hopefully better dataset. Also finished the SQL Course

**Thoughts:** Gonna run the database generation tonight, see how it goes. Will need to find some sweet and cheap Cloud GPU for the training process at some point. 

Learned that running courses doesn't technically count as coding during this challenge. Will keep that in mind from now on!

### Day 2: December 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly Learning about Machine Learning Concepts and applications in Python.
This includes Concepts such as the general structure of a Feed Forward Neural Network

Loss Functions such as : Binary Cross Entropy, Cross Entropy, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Activation Functions such as: Linear, Sigmoid, RELU and Hyberbolic

Also played around with OpenAI library and an Actor-Critic-Agent for solving the Pendulum Problem

### Day 3: December 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: starting a Frogger Game with Pygame Library as a Framework. 

So far the frog looks froggy and can move trough the environment like a boss. The environment is currently empty though.
