### Day 1: December 16, 2017
Skipped a day, b.c. of reasons.

**Today's Progress**: worked on my chatbot, inspired by sentdex, improving database generation für a larger and hopefully better dataset

**Thoughts:** Gonna run the database generation tonight, see how it goes. Will need to find some sweet and cheap Cloud GPU for the training process at some point.

**Link to work:** my own repo on the reddit-chatbot :)
