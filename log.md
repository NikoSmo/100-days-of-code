# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 75% of the SQL Codecademy Course

**Thoughts:** Learned concepts such as :
CREATE TABLE, UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, SET, WHERE, CASE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM, AVG . . .

### Day 1: December 16, 2017
Skipped a day, b.c. of reasons.

**Today's Progress**: worked on my chatbot, inspired by sentdex, improving database generation für a larger and hopefully better dataset. Also finished the SQL Course

**Thoughts:** Gonna run the database generation tonight, see how it goes. Will need to find some sweet and cheap Cloud GPU for the training process at some point. 

Learned that running courses doesn't technically count as coding during this challenge. Will keep that in mind from now on! 

**Link to work:** my own repo on the reddit-chatbot :)

### Day 2: December 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Mostly Learning about Machine Learning Concepts and applications in Python.
This includes Concepts such as the general structure of a Feed Forward Neural Network

Loss Functions such as : Binary Cross Entropy, Cross Entropy, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Activation Functions such as: Linear, Sigmoid, RELU and Hyberbolic

Also played around with OpenAI library and an Actor-Critic-Agent for solving the Pendulum Problem

### Day 3: December 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: starting a Frogger Game with Pygame Library as a Framework. 

So far the frog looks froggy and can move trough the environment like a boss. The environment is currently empty though.

### Day 5: December 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: On Frogger -> Trunks And Score- and Lifeboard are now in the frogger game

### Day 6: December 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**: On Frogger -> Cars are now available. Also Safe Zones and Collision Handlers are available now.

**Thoughts:** Boundaries need to be set next. Also realize i was spoiled using Unity before handling this stuff for me :)

### Day 7: December 21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: On Frogger -> Game Design improved. Game Functionality including borders is now mostly finished. Game is playable.

Also Obstacles such as Trunks and Cars are now correctly deleted upon leaving the map.

**Thoughts**: Need to find a way to naturally spawn obstacles without collisions

### Day 8: December 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: On Frogger -> Didn't get done much today ;/.  Rework of Game Art using new transparent sprites, making the game slightly less hideous. 

### Day 9: December 23, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Yet another Art Design Change. This time for the Environment. Also changed issues with the collision handling by fixing the obstacles sizes. Played around with offsets in the game to make Frogs, Obstacles and Environment more aligned with each other.

Also now running a NMT-Chatbot Training Session on my local PC using a one month modified dataset from reddit data. The training Process will probably take a few days. Can't wait to see the results. I'll probably do some sort of afterprocessing on the 
model and might even make it into a twitter bot for jokes. We'll see.

### Cheat Day: December 24. 2017
No Progress Today because of holiday and family. Will start tomorrow again.

### Day 10: December 25, 2017
**Today's Progress**: On Frogger -> Implemented the random Obstacle Generation for Trunks and Cars and removed colliding Obstacles.
Project is done!

### Day 11: December 26, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Mostly HTML and CSS readup. Also refreshed knowledge about the functionality of a Feedforward Deep Neural Network.

### Cheat Day: December 27. 2017
No Progress Today because of holiday and family.

### Cheat Day: December 28. 2017
